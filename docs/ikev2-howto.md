## Introduction

Modern operating systems support the IKEv2 standard. Internet Key Exchange (IKE or IKEv2) is the protocol used to set up a Security Association (SA) in the IPsec protocol suite. Compared to IKE version 1, IKEv2 contains [improvements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Key_Exchange#Improvements_with_IKEv2) such as Standard Mobility support through MOBIKE, and improved reliability.

Libreswan can authenticate IKEv2 clients on the basis of X.509 Machine Certificates using RSA signatures. This method does not require an IPsec PSK, username or password. It can be used with Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Chrome OS, Linux and RouterOS.

By default, IKEv2 is automatically set up when running the VPN setup script. If you want to learn more about setting up IKEv2, see [Set up IKEv2 using helper script](#set-up-ikev2-using-helper-script). Docker users, see [Configure and use IKEv2 VPN](https://github.com/hwdsl2/docker-ipsec-vpn-server/blob/master/README.md#configure-and-use-ikev2-vpn).

## Configure IKEv2 VPN clients

**Note:** To add or export IKEv2 clients, run `sudo ikev2.sh`. Use `-h` to show usage. Client config files can be safely deleted after import.

Learn how to change the IKEv2 server address.
</summary>

In certain circumstances, you may need to change the IKEv2 server address. For example, to switch to use a DNS name, or after server IP changes. Learn more in [this section](#change-ikev2-server-address).
</details>

### Windows 7, 8, 10 and 11

#### Auto-import configuration

[**Screencast:** IKEv2 Auto Import Configuration on Windows](https://ko-fi.com/post/IKEv2-Auto-Import-Configuration-on-Windows-8-10-a-K3K1DQCHW)

**Windows 8, 10 and 11** users can automatically import IKEv2 configuration:

1. Securely transfer the generated `.p12` file to your computer.
1. Right-click on [ikev2_config_import.cmd](https://github.com/hwdsl2/vpn-extras/releases/latest/download/ikev2_config_import.cmd) and save this helper script to the **same folder** as the `.p12` file.
1. Right-click on the saved script, select **Properties**. Click on **Unblock** at the bottom, then click on **OK**.
1. Right-click on the saved script, select **Run as administrator** and follow the prompts.

To connect to the VPN: Click on the wireless/network icon in your system tray, select the new VPN entry, and click **Connect**. Once connected, you can verify that your traffic is being routed properly by [looking up your IP address on Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=my+ip). It should say "Your public IP address is `Your VPN Server IP`".

If you get an error when trying to connect, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

#### Manually import configuration

[[Supporters] **Screencast:** IKEv2 Manually Import Configuration on Windows](https://ko-fi.com/post/Support-this-project-and-get-access-to-supporter-o-O5O7FVF8J)

Alternatively, **Windows 7, 8, 10 and 11** users can manually import IKEv2 configuration:

1. Securely transfer the generated `.p12` file to your computer, then import it into the certificate store.

   To import the `.p12` file, run the following from an [elevated command prompt](http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/open-elevated-command-prompt-windows/):

   ```console
   # Import .p12 file (replace with your own value)
   certutil -f -importpfx "\path\to\your\file.p12" NoExport
   ```

   **Note:** If there is no password for client config files, press Enter to continue, or if manually importing the `.p12` file, leave the password field blank.

   Alternatively, you can [manually import the .p12 file](https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/Win7Certs/9). Make sure that the client cert is placed in "Personal -> Certificates", and the CA cert is placed in "Trusted Root Certification Authorities -> Certificates".

1. On the Windows computer, add a new IKEv2 VPN connection.

   For **Windows 8, 10 and 11**, it is recommended to create the VPN connection using the following commands from a command prompt, for improved security and performance.

   ```console
   # Create VPN connection (replace server address with your own value)
   powershell -command ^"Add-VpnConnection -ServerAddress 'Your VPN Server IP (or DNS name)' ^
     -Name 'My IKEv2 VPN' -TunnelType IKEv2 -AuthenticationMethod MachineCertificate ^
     -EncryptionLevel Required -PassThru^"
   # Set IPsec configuration
   powershell -command ^"Set-VpnConnectionIPsecConfiguration -ConnectionName 'My IKEv2 VPN' ^
     -AuthenticationTransformConstants GCMAES128 -CipherTransformConstants GCMAES128 ^
     -EncryptionMethod AES256 -IntegrityCheckMethod SHA256 -PfsGroup None ^
     -DHGroup Group14 -PassThru -Force^"
   ```

   **Windows 7** does not support these commands, you can [manually create the VPN connection](https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/Win7Config/8).

   **Note:** The server address you specify must **exactly match** the server address in the output of the IKEv2 helper script. For example, if you specified the server's DNS name during IKEv2 setup, you must enter the DNS name in the **Internet address** field.

1. **This step is required if you manually created the VPN connection.**

   Enable stronger ciphers for IKEv2 with a one-time registry change. Download and import the `.reg` file below, or run the following from an elevated command prompt. Read more [here](https://docs.strongswan.org/docs/5.9/interop/windowsClients.html).

   - For Windows 7, 8, 10 and 11 ([download .reg file](https://github.com/hwdsl2/vpn-extras/releases/download/v1.0.0/Enable_Stronger_Ciphers_for_IKEv2_on_Windows.reg))

     ```console
     REG ADD HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan\Parameters /v NegotiateDH2048_AES256 /t REG_DWORD /d 0x1 /f
     ```

To connect to the VPN: Click on the wireless/network icon in your system tray, select the new VPN entry, and click **Connect**. Once connected, you can verify that your traffic is being routed properly by [looking up your IP address on Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=my+ip). It should say "Your public IP address is `Your VPN Server IP`".

If you get an error when trying to connect, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

(Optional feature) You can choose to enable the "Always-on VPN" feature on Chrome OS. To manage this setting, go to Settings -> Network, then click **VPN**.

If you get an error when trying to connect, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

### Linux

Before configuring Linux VPN clients, you must make the following change on the VPN server: Edit `/etc/ipsec.d/ikev2.conf` on the server. Append `authby=rsa-sha1` to the end of the `conn ikev2-cp` section, indented by two spaces. Save the file and run `service ipsec restart`.

To configure your Linux computer to connect to IKEv2 as a VPN client, first install the strongSwan plugin for NetworkManager:

```bash
# Ubuntu and Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install network-manager-strongswan

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -Syu  # upgrade all packages
sudo pacman -S networkmanager-strongswan

# Fedora
sudo yum install NetworkManager-strongswan-gnome

# CentOS
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum --enablerepo=epel install NetworkManager-strongswan-gnome
```

Next, securely transfer the generated `.p12` file from the VPN server to your Linux computer. After that, extract the CA certificate, client certificate and private key. Replace `vpnclient.p12` in the example below with the name of your `.p12` file.

```bash
# Example: Extract CA certificate, client certificate and private key.
#          You may delete the .p12 file when finished.
# Note: You may need to enter the import password, which can be found
#       in the output of the IKEv2 helper script. If the output does not
#       contain an import password, press Enter to continue.
# Note: If using OpenSSL 3.x (run "openssl version" to check),
#       append "-legacy" to the 3 commands below.
openssl pkcs12 -in vpnclient.p12 -cacerts -nokeys -out ca.cer
openssl pkcs12 -in vpnclient.p12 -clcerts -nokeys -out client.cer
openssl pkcs12 -in vpnclient.p12 -nocerts -nodes  -out client.key
rm vpnclient.p12

# (Important) Protect certificate and private key files
# Note: This step is optional, but strongly recommended.
sudo chown root.root ca.cer client.cer client.key
sudo chmod 600 ca.cer client.cer client.key
```

You can then set up and enable the VPN connection:

1. Go to Settings -> Network -> VPN. Click the **+** button.
1. Select **IPsec/IKEv2 (strongswan)**.
1. Enter anything you like in the **Name** field.
1. In the **Gateway (Server)** section, enter `Your VPN Server IP` (or DNS name) for the **Address**.
1. Select the `ca.cer` file for the **Certificate**.
1. In the **Client** section, select **Certificate(/private key)** in the **Authentication** drop-down menu.
1. Select **Certificate/private key** in the **Certificate** drop-down menu (if exists).
1. Select the `client.cer` file for the **Certificate (file)**.
1. Select the `client.key` file for the **Private key**.
1. In the **Options** section, check the **Request an inner IP address** checkbox.
1. In the **Cipher proposals (Algorithms)** section, check the **Enable custom proposals** checkbox.
1. Leave the **IKE** field blank.
1. Enter `aes128gcm16` in the **ESP** field.
1. Click **Add** to save the VPN connection information.
1. Turn the **VPN** switch ON.

Once connected, you can verify that your traffic is being routed properly by [looking up your IP address on Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=my+ip). It should say "Your public IP address is `Your VPN Server IP`".

If you get an error when trying to connect, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

### RouterOS

**Note:** These steps were contributed by [@Unix-User](https://github.com/Unix-User). It is recommended to run terminal commands via an SSH connection, e.g. via Putty.

1. Securely transfer the generated `.p12` file to your computer.

   <details>
   <summary>
   Click to see screencast.
   </summary>

   ![routeros get certificate](images/routeros-get-cert.gif)
   </details>

2. In WinBox, go to System > certificates > import. Import the `.p12` certificate file twice (yes, import the same file two times!). Verify in your certificates panel. You will see 2 files, the one that is marked KT is the key.

   <details>
   <summary>
   Click to see screencast.
   </summary>

   ![routeros import certificate](images/routeros-import-cert.gif)
   </details>

   Or you can use terminal instead (empty passphrase):

   ```bash
   [admin@MikroTik] > /certificate/import file-name=mikrotik.p12
   passphrase:

     certificates-imported: 2
     private-keys-imported: 0
            files-imported: 1
       decryption-failures: 0
     keys-with-no-certificate: 0

   [admin@MikroTik] > /certificate/import file-name=mikrotik.p12
   passphrase:

        certificates-imported: 0
        private-keys-imported: 1
               files-imported: 1
          decryption-failures: 0
     keys-with-no-certificate: 0

   ```

3. Run these commands in terminal. Replace the following with your own values.
`YOUR_VPN_SERVER_IP_OR_DNS_NAME` is your VPN server IP or DNS name.
`IMPORTED_CERTIFICATE` is the name of the certificate from step 2 above, e.g. `vpnclient.p12_0`
(the one flagged with KT - Priv. Key Trusted - if not flagged as KT, import certificate again).
`THESE_ADDRESSES_GO_THROUGH_VPN` are the local network addresses that you want to browse through the VPN.
Assuming that your local network behind RouterOS is `192.168.0.0/24`, you can use `192.168.0.0/24`
for the entire network, or use `192.168.0.10` for just one device, and so on.

   ```bash
   /ip firewall address-list add address=THESE_ADDRESSES_GO_THROUGH_VPN list=local
   /ip ipsec mode-config add name=ike2-rw responder=no src-address-list=local
   /ip ipsec policy group add name=ike2-rw
   /ip ipsec profile add name=ike2-rw
   /ip ipsec peer add address=YOUR_VPN_SERVER_IP_OR_DNS_NAME exchange-mode=ike2 \
       name=ike2-rw-client profile=ike2-rw
   /ip ipsec proposal add name=ike2-rw pfs-group=none
   /ip ipsec identity add auth-method=digital-signature certificate=IMPORTED_CERTIFICATE \
       generate-policy=port-strict mode-config=ike2-rw \
       peer=ike2-rw-client policy-template-group=ike2-rw
   /ip ipsec policy add group=ike2-rw proposal=ike2-rw template=yes
   ```

### Cannot connect to the VPN server

First, make sure that the VPN server address specified on your VPN client device **exactly matches** the server address in the output of the IKEv2 helper script. Refer to the sections below and [Check logs and VPN status](clients.md#check-logs-and-vpn-status).

For servers with an external firewall (e.g. [EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html)/[GCE](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls)), open UDP ports 500 and 4500 for the VPN. Aliyun users, see [#433](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/issues/433).

### Unable to connect multiple IKEv2 clients

To connect multiple IKEv2 clients from behind the same NAT (e.g. home router) at the same time, you will need to generate a unique certificate for each client. Otherwise, you could encounter the issue where a later connected client affects the VPN connection of an existing client, which may lose Internet access.

To generate certificates for additional IKEv2 clients, run the helper script with the `--addclient` option. To customize client options, run the script without arguments.

```bash
sudo ikev2.sh --addclient [client name]
```

### IKE authentication credentials are unacceptable

If you encounter this error, make sure that the VPN server address specified on your VPN client device **exactly matches** the server address in the output of the IKEv2 helper script. For example, you cannot use a DNS name to connect if it was not specified when setting up IKEv2. To change the IKEv2 server address, read [this section](#change-ikev2-server-address).

### Policy match error

To fix this error, you will need to enable stronger ciphers for IKEv2 with a one-time registry change. Download and import the `.reg` file below, or run the following from an elevated command prompt.

- For Windows 7, 8, 10 and 11 ([download .reg file](https://github.com/hwdsl2/vpn-extras/releases/download/v1.0.0/Enable_Stronger_Ciphers_for_IKEv2_on_Windows.reg))

```console
REG ADD HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan\Parameters /v NegotiateDH2048_AES256 /t REG_DWORD /d 0x1 /f
```

### Parameter is incorrect

If you encounter "Error 87: The parameter is incorrect" when trying to connect using IKEv2 mode, try the solutions in [this issue](https://github.com/trailofbits/algo/issues/1051), more specifically, step 2 "reset device manager adapters".

### Cannot open websites after connecting to IKEv2

If your VPN client device cannot open websites after successfully connecting to IKEv2, try the following fixes:

1. Some cloud providers, such as [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com), [set a lower MTU by default](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/vpn/concepts/mtu-considerations). This could cause network issues with IKEv2 VPN clients. To fix, try setting the MTU to 1500 on the VPN server:

   ```bash
   # Replace ens4 with the network interface name on your server
   sudo ifconfig ens4 mtu 1500
   ```

   This setting **does not** persist after a reboot. To change the MTU size permanently, refer to relevant articles on the web.

1. If changing the MTU size does not fix the issue, try the fix in [Android MTU/MSS issues](clients.md#android-mtumss-issues).

1. In certain circumstances, Windows does not use the DNS servers specified by IKEv2 after connecting. This can be fixed by manually entering DNS servers such as Google Public DNS (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4) in network interface properties -> TCP/IPv4.

### Windows 10 connecting

If using Windows 10 and the VPN is stuck on "connecting" for more than a few minutes, try these steps:

1. Right-click on the wireless/network icon in your system tray.
1. Select **Open Network & Internet settings**, then on the page that opens, click **VPN** on the left.
1. Select the new VPN entry, then click **Connect**.

### Other known issues

The built-in VPN client in Windows may not support IKEv2 fragmentation (this feature [requires](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-ikee/74df968a-7125-431d-9c98-4ea929e548dc) Windows 10 v1803 or newer). On some networks, this can cause the connection to fail or have other issues. You may instead try the [IPsec/L2TP](clients.md) or [IPsec/XAuth](clients-xauth.md) mode.

## Manage IKEv2 clients

* [List existing clients](#list-existing-clients)
* [Add a client certificate](#add-a-client-certificate)
* [Export configuration for an existing client](#export-configuration-for-an-existing-client)
* [Delete a client certificate](#delete-a-client-certificate)
* [Revoke a client certificate](#revoke-a-client-certificate)

### List existing clients

To list the names of existing IKEv2 clients, run the helper script with the `--listclients` option. Use option `-h` to show usage.

```bash
sudo ikev2.sh --listclients
```

### Add a client certificate

To generate certificates for additional IKEv2 clients, run the helper script with the `--addclient` option. To customize client options, run the script without arguments.

```bash
sudo ikev2.sh --addclient [client name]
```

Alternatively, you may manually add a client certificate. Refer to step 4 in [this section](#manually-set-up-ikev2).

### Export configuration for an existing client

By default, the IKEv2 helper script exports client configuration after running. If later you want to export an existing client, you may use:

```bash
sudo ikev2.sh --exportclient [client name]
```

### Delete a client certificate

**Important:** Deleting a client certificate from the IPsec database **WILL NOT** prevent VPN client(s) from connecting using that certificate! For this use case, you **MUST** [revoke the client certificate](#revoke-a-client-certificate) instead of deleting it.

<details>
<summary>
First, read the important note above. Then click here for instructions.
</summary>

**Warning:** The client certificate and private key will be **permanently deleted**. This **cannot be undone**!

To delete an existing client:

```bash
sudo ikev2.sh --deleteclient [client name]
```

<details>
<summary>
Alternatively, you can manually delete a client certificate.
</summary>

1. List certificates in the IPsec database:

   ```bash
   certutil -L -d sql:/etc/ipsec.d
   ```

   Example output:

   ```
   Certificate Nickname                               Trust Attributes
                                                      SSL,S/MIME,JAR/XPI

   IKEv2 VPN CA                                       CTu,u,u
   ($PUBLIC_IP)                                       u,u,u
   vpnclient                                          u,u,u
   ```

1. Delete the client certificate and private key. Replace "Nickname" below with the nickname of the client certificate you want to delete, e.g. `vpnclient`.

   ```bash
   certutil -F -d sql:/etc/ipsec.d -n "Nickname"
   certutil -D -d sql:/etc/ipsec.d -n "Nickname" 2>/dev/null
   ```

1. (Optional) Delete the previously generated client configuration files (`.p12`, `.mobileconfig` and `.sswan` files) for this VPN client, if any.
</details>
</details>

### Revoke a client certificate

In certain circumstances, you may need to revoke a previously generated VPN client certificate.

To revoke an existing client:

```bash
sudo ikev2.sh --revokeclient [client name]
```

<details>
<summary>
Alternatively, you can manually revoke a client certificate.
</summary>

Alternatively, you can manually revoke a client certificate. This can be done using `crlutil`. See example steps below, commands must be run as `root`.

1. Check the database, and identify the nickname of the client certificate you want to revoke.

   ```bash
   certutil -L -d sql:/etc/ipsec.d
   ```

   ```
   Certificate Nickname                               Trust Attributes
                                                      SSL,S/MIME,JAR/XPI

   IKEv2 VPN CA                                       CTu,u,u
   ($PUBLIC_IP)                                       u,u,u
   vpnclient-to-revoke                                u,u,u
   ```

   In this example, we will revoke the certificate with nickname `vpnclient-to-revoke`, issued by `IKEv2 VPN CA`.

1. Find the serial number of this client certificate.

   ```bash
   certutil -L -d sql:/etc/ipsec.d -n "vpnclient-to-revoke"
   ```

   ```
   Certificate:
       Data:
           Version: 3 (0x2)
           Serial Number:
               00:cd:69:ff:74
   ... ...
   ```

   From the output, we see that the serial number is `CD69FF74` in hexadecimal, which is `3446275956` in decimal. It will be used in the next steps.

1. Create a new Certificate Revocation List (CRL). You only need to do this once for each CA.

   ```bash
   if ! crlutil -L -d sql:/etc/ipsec.d -n "IKEv2 VPN CA" 2>/dev/null; then
     crlutil -G -d sql:/etc/ipsec.d -n "IKEv2 VPN CA" -c /dev/null
   fi
   ```

   ```
   CRL Info:
   :
       Version: 2 (0x1)
       Signature Algorithm: PKCS #1 SHA-256 With RSA Encryption
       Issuer: "O=IKEv2 VPN,CN=IKEv2 VPN CA"
       This Update: Sat Jun 06 22:00:00 2020
       CRL Extensions:
   ```

1. Add the client certificate you want to revoke to the CRL. Here we specify the certificate's serial number in decimal, and the revocation time in GeneralizedTime format (YYYYMMDDhhmmssZ) in UTC.

   ```bash
   crlutil -M -d sql:/etc/ipsec.d -n "IKEv2 VPN CA" <<EOF
   addcert 3446275956 20200606220100Z
   EOF
   ```

   ```
   CRL Info:
   :
       Version: 2 (0x1)
       Signature Algorithm: PKCS #1 SHA-256 With RSA Encryption
       Issuer: "O=IKEv2 VPN,CN=IKEv2 VPN CA"
       This Update: Sat Jun 06 22:02:00 2020
       Entry 1 (0x1):
           Serial Number:
               00:cd:69:ff:74
           Revocation Date: Sat Jun 06 22:01:00 2020
       CRL Extensions:
   ```

   **Note:** If you want to remove a certificate from the CRL, replace `addcert 3446275956 20200606220100Z` above with `rmcert 3446275956`. For other `crlutil` usage, read [here](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/security/nss/legacy/tools/nss_tools_crlutil/index.html).

1. Finally, let Libreswan re-read the updated CRL.

   ```bash
   ipsec crls
   ```
</details>

## Change IKEv2 server address

In certain circumstances, you may need to change the IKEv2 server address after setup. For example, to switch to use a DNS name, or after server IP changes. Note that the server address you specify on VPN client devices must **exactly match** the server address in the output of the IKEv2 helper script. Otherwise, devices may be unable to connect.

To change the server address, run the [helper script](../extras/ikev2changeaddr.sh) and follow the prompts.

```bash
wget https://get.vpnsetup.net/ikev2addr -O ikev2addr.sh
sudo bash ikev2addr.sh
```

**Important:** After running this script, you must manually update the server address (and remote ID, if applicable) on any existing IKEv2 client devices. For iOS clients, you'll need to export and re-import client configuration using the IKEv2 [helper script](#set-up-ikev2-using-helper-script).

## Update IKEv2 helper script

The IKEv2 helper script is updated from time to time for bug fixes and improvements ([commit log](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/commits/master/extras/ikev2setup.sh)). When a newer version is available, you may optionally update the IKEv2 helper script on your server. Note that these commands will overwrite any existing `ikev2.sh`.

```bash
wget https://get.vpnsetup.net/ikev2 -O /opt/src/ikev2.sh
chmod +x /opt/src/ikev2.sh && ln -s /opt/src/ikev2.sh /usr/bin 2>/dev/null
```

## Set up IKEv2 using helper script

**Note:** By default, IKEv2 is automatically set up when running the VPN setup script. You may skip this section and continue to [configure IKEv2 VPN clients](#configure-ikev2-vpn-clients).

**Important:** Before continuing, you should have successfully [set up your own VPN server](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn). **Docker users, see [here](https://github.com/hwdsl2/docker-ipsec-vpn-server/blob/master/README.md#configure-and-use-ikev2-vpn)**.

Use this [helper script](../extras/ikev2setup.sh) to automatically set up IKEv2 on the VPN server:

```bash
# Set up IKEv2 using default options
sudo ikev2.sh --auto
# Alternatively, you may customize IKEv2 options
sudo ikev2.sh
```

**Note:** If IKEv2 is already set up, but you want to customize IKEv2 options, first [remove IKEv2](#remove-ikev2), then set it up again using `sudo ikev2.sh`.

When finished, continue to [configure IKEv2 VPN clients](#configure-ikev2-vpn-clients). Advanced users can optionally enable [IKEv2-only mode](advanced-usage.md#ikev2-only-vpn).

<details>
<summary>
Error: "sudo: ikev2.sh: command not found".
</summary>

This is normal if you used an older version of the VPN setup script. First, download the IKEv2 helper script:

```bash
wget https://get.vpnsetup.net/ikev2 -O /opt/src/ikev2.sh
chmod +x /opt/src/ikev2.sh && ln -s /opt/src/ikev2.sh /usr/bin
```

Then run the script using the instructions above.
</details>
<details>
<summary>
You may optionally specify a DNS name, client name and/or custom DNS servers.
</summary>

When running IKEv2 setup in auto mode, advanced users can optionally specify a DNS name for the IKEv2 server address. The DNS name must be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). Example:

```bash
sudo VPN_DNS_NAME='vpn.example.com' ikev2.sh --auto
```

Similarly, you may specify a name for the first IKEv2 client. The default is `vpnclient` if not specified.

```bash
sudo VPN_CLIENT_NAME='your_client_name' ikev2.sh --auto
```

By default, IKEv2 clients are set to use [Google Public DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/) when the VPN is active. You may specify custom DNS server(s) for IKEv2. Example:

```bash
sudo VPN_DNS_SRV1=1.1.1.1 VPN_DNS_SRV2=1.0.0.1 ikev2.sh --auto
```

By default, no password is required when importing IKEv2 client configuration. You can choose to protect client config files using a random password.

```bash
sudo VPN_PROTECT_CONFIG=yes ikev2.sh --auto
```
</details>
<details>

To customize IKEv2 or client options, run this script without arguments.
```
</details>

## Manually set up IKEv2

As an alternative to using the [helper script](#set-up-ikev2-using-helper-script), advanced users can manually set up IKEv2 on the VPN server. Before continuing, it is recommended to [update Libreswan](../README.md#upgrade-libreswan) to the latest version.

The following example shows how to manually configure IKEv2 with Libreswan. Commands below must be run as `root`.

<details>
<summary>
View example steps for manually configuring IKEv2 with Libreswan.
</summary>

1. Find the VPN server's public IP, save it to a variable and check.

   ```bash
   PUBLIC_IP=$(dig @resolver1.opendns.com -t A -4 myip.opendns.com +short)
   [ -z "$PUBLIC_IP" ] && PUBLIC_IP=$(wget -t 2 -T 10 -qO- http://ipv4.icanhazip.com)
   printf '%s\n' "$PUBLIC_IP"
   ```

   Check to make sure the output matches the server's public IP. This variable is required in the steps below.

   **Note:** Alternatively, you may specify the server's DNS name here. e.g. `PUBLIC_IP=myvpn.example.com`.

1. Add a new IKEv2 connection:

   ```bash
   if ! grep -qs '^include /etc/ipsec\.d/\*\.conf$' /etc/ipsec.conf; then
     echo >> /etc/ipsec.conf
     echo 'include /etc/ipsec.d/*.conf' >> /etc/ipsec.conf
   fi
   ```

   **Note:** If you specified the server's DNS name (instead of its IP address) in step 1 above, you must replace `leftid=$PUBLIC_IP` in the command below with `leftid=@$PUBLIC_IP`.

   ```bash
   cat > /etc/ipsec.d/ikev2.conf <<EOF

   conn ikev2-cp
     left=%defaultroute
     leftcert=$PUBLIC_IP
     leftid=$PUBLIC_IP
     leftsendcert=always
     leftsubnet=0.0.0.0/0
     leftrsasigkey=%cert
     right=%any
     rightid=%fromcert
     rightaddresspool=192.168.43.10-192.168.43.250
     rightca=%same
     rightrsasigkey=%cert
     narrowing=yes
     dpddelay=30
     retransmit-timeout=300s
     dpdaction=clear
     auto=add
     ikev2=insist
     rekey=no
     pfs=no
     ike=aes256-sha2,aes128-sha2,aes256-sha1,aes128-sha1
     phase2alg=aes_gcm-null,aes128-sha1,aes256-sha1,aes128-sha2,aes256-sha2
     ikelifetime=24h
     salifetime=24h
   EOF
   ```

   We need to add a few more lines to that file. First check your Libreswan version, then run one of the following commands:

   ```bash
   ipsec --version
   ```

   For Libreswan 3.23 and newer:

   ```bash
   cat >> /etc/ipsec.d/ikev2.conf <<EOF
     modecfgdns="8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4"
     encapsulation=yes
     mobike=no
   EOF
   ```

   **Note:** The MOBIKE IKEv2 extension allows VPN clients to change network attachment points, e.g. switch between mobile data and Wi-Fi and keep the IPsec tunnel up on the new IP. If your server (or Docker host) is **NOT** running Ubuntu Linux, and you wish to enable MOBIKE support, replace `mobike=no` with `mobike=yes` in the command above. **DO NOT** enable this option on Ubuntu systems or Raspberry Pis.

   For Libreswan 3.19-3.22:

   ```bash
   cat >> /etc/ipsec.d/ikev2.conf <<EOF
     modecfgdns1=8.8.8.8
     modecfgdns2=8.8.4.4
     encapsulation=yes
   EOF
   ```

   For Libreswan 3.18 and older:

   ```bash
   cat >> /etc/ipsec.d/ikev2.conf <<EOF
     modecfgdns1=8.8.8.8
     modecfgdns2=8.8.4.4
     forceencaps=yes
   EOF
   ```

1. Generate Certificate Authority (CA) and VPN server certificates.

   **Note:** Specify the certificate validity period (in months) with "-v". e.g. "-v 120".

   Generate CA certificate:

   ```bash
   certutil -z <(head -c 1024 /dev/urandom) \

   Generate VPN server certificate:

   **Note:** If you specified the server's DNS name (instead of its IP address) in step 1 above, you must replace `--extSAN "ip:$PUBLIC_IP,dns:$PUBLIC_IP"` in the command below with `--extSAN "dns:$PUBLIC_IP"`.

   ```bash
   certutil -z <(head -c 1024 /dev/urandom) \
     -S -c "IKEv2 VPN CA" -n "$PUBLIC_IP" \
     -s "O=IKEv2 VPN,CN=$PUBLIC_IP" \
     -k rsa -g 3072 -v 120 \
     -d sql:/etc/ipsec.d -t ",," \
     --keyUsage digitalSignature,keyEncipherment \
     --extKeyUsage serverAuth \
     --extSAN "ip:$PUBLIC_IP,dns:$PUBLIC_IP"
   ```

   ```
   Generating key.  This may take a few moments...
   ```

1. Generate client certificate(s), then export the `.p12` file that contains the client certificate, private key, and CA certificate.

   **Note:** You may repeat this step to generate certificates for additional VPN clients, but make sure to replace every `vpnclient` with `vpnclient2`, etc. To connect multiple IKEv2 clients from behind the same NAT (e.g. home router) at the same time, you will need to generate a unique certificate for each client.

   Generate client certificate:

   ```bash
   certutil -z <(head -c 1024 /dev/urandom) \
     -S -c "IKEv2 VPN CA" -n "vpnclient" \
     -s "O=IKEv2 VPN,CN=vpnclient" \
     -k rsa -g 3072 -v 120 \
     -d sql:/etc/ipsec.d -t ",," \
     --keyUsage digitalSignature,keyEncipherment \
     --extKeyUsage serverAuth,clientAuth -8 "vpnclient"
   ```

   ```
   Generating key.  This may take a few moments...
   ```

   Export `.p12` file:

   ```bash
   pk12util -d sql:/etc/ipsec.d -n "vpnclient" -o vpnclient.p12
   ```

   ```
   Enter password for PKCS12 file:
   Re-enter password:
   pk12util: PKCS12 EXPORT SUCCESSFUL
   ```

   Enter a secure password to protect the exported `.p12` file (when importing into an iOS or macOS device, this password cannot be empty).

1. (For iOS clients) Export the CA certificate as `ca.cer`:

   ```bash
   certutil -L -d sql:/etc/ipsec.d -n "IKEv2 VPN CA" -a -o ca.cer
   ```

1. The database should now contain:

   ```bash
   certutil -L -d sql:/etc/ipsec.d
   ```

   ```
   Certificate Nickname                               Trust Attributes
                                                      SSL,S/MIME,JAR/XPI

   IKEv2 VPN CA                                       CTu,u,u
   ($PUBLIC_IP)                                       u,u,u
   vpnclient                                          u,u,u
   ```

   **Note:** To display a certificate, use `certutil -L -d sql:/etc/ipsec.d -n "Nickname"`. To revoke a client certificate, follow [these steps](#revoke-a-client-certificate). For other `certutil` usage, read [here](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/security/nss/legacy/tools/nss_tools_certutil/index.html).

1. **(Important) Restart the IPsec service**:

   ```bash
   service ipsec restart
   ```

Before continuing, you **must** restart the IPsec service. The IKEv2 setup on the VPN server is now complete. Follow instructions to [configure VPN clients](#configure-ikev2-vpn-clients).

## Remove IKEv2

If you want to remove IKEv2 from the VPN server, but keep the [IPsec/L2TP](clients.md) and [IPsec/XAuth ("Cisco IPsec")](clients-xauth.md) modes (if installed), run the helper script. **Warning:** All IKEv2 configuration including certificates and keys will be **permanently deleted**. This **cannot be undone**!

```bash
sudo ikev2.sh --removeikev2
```

After removing IKEv2, if you want to set it up again, refer to [this section](#set-up-ikev2-using-helper-script).

<details>
<summary>
Alternatively, you can manually remove IKEv2.
</summary>

To manually remove IKEv2 from the VPN server, but keep the [IPsec/L2TP](clients.md) and [IPsec/XAuth ("Cisco IPsec")](clients-xauth.md) modes, follow these steps. Commands must be run as `root`.

**Warning:** All IKEv2 configuration including certificates and keys will be **permanently deleted**. This **cannot be undone**!

1. Rename (or delete) the IKEv2 config file:

   ```bash
   mv /etc/ipsec.d/ikev2.conf /etc/ipsec.d/ikev2.conf.bak
   ```

   **Note:** If you used an older version (before 2020-05-31) of the IKEv2 helper script or instructions, file `/etc/ipsec.d/ikev2.conf` may not exist. In this case, please instead remove the `conn ikev2-cp` section from file `/etc/ipsec.conf`.

1. **(Important) Restart the IPsec service**:

   ```bash
   service ipsec restart
   ```

1. List certificates in the IPsec database:

   ```bash
   certutil -L -d sql:/etc/ipsec.d
   ```

   Example output:

   ```
   Certificate Nickname                               Trust Attributes
                                                      SSL,S/MIME,JAR/XPI

   IKEv2 VPN CA                                       CTu,u,u
   ($PUBLIC_IP)                                       u,u,u
   vpnclient                                          u,u,u
   ```

1. Delete the Certificate Revocation List (CRL), if any:

   ```bash
   crlutil -D -d sql:/etc/ipsec.d -n "IKEv2 VPN CA" 2>/dev/null
   ```

1. Delete certificates and keys. Replace "Nickname" below with each certificate's nickname. Repeat these commands for each certificate. When finished, list certificates in the IPsec database again, and confirm that the list is empty.

   ```bash
   certutil -F -d sql:/etc/ipsec.d -n "Nickname"
   certutil -D -d sql:/etc/ipsec.d -n "Nickname" 2>/dev/null
   ```
